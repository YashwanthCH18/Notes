> # TRANSACTION

A **transaction** in a database is a sequence of one or more operations (such as **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**) executed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction ensures **data integrity** by following the **ACID properties**:  

- **Atomicity** ‚Äì The transaction is all or nothing. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.  
- **Consistency** ‚Äì The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.  
- **Isolation** ‚Äì Transactions do not interfere with each other.  
- **Durability** ‚Äì Once a transaction is committed, changes are permanent even after a crash.  

### **Types of Transactions in Databases**

1. **Read-Only Transactions**  
   
   - These transactions only **read data** and do not modify it.  
   - Example: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;`  

2. **Read-Write Transactions**  
   
   - These involve both reading and modifying data.  
   
   - Example:  
     
     ```sql
     START TRANSACTION;
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
     COMMIT;
     ```

3. **Distributed Transactions**  
   
   - These span multiple databases or servers and require a **two-phase commit (2PC)** to ensure consistency.  
   - Example: Transferring money between two bank databases.  

4. **Nested Transactions**  
   
   - A transaction inside another transaction. If the inner transaction fails, it rolls back without affecting the outer transaction.  
   - Not all databases support nested transactions.  

5. **Compensating Transactions**  
   
   - Used to reverse the effects of a previous transaction if something goes wrong.  
   - Example: A refund process in an e-commerce system.  

> # ISOLATION LEVELS IN ACID PROPERTIES:-

This slide is discussing **levels of isolation in database transactions** in simple terms. 

When multiple users or processes try to access and modify a database at the same time, we need **isolation levels** to prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity. Isolation levels determine how much one transaction is affected by other ongoing transactions. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the levels in simple terms:

1. **Level 0 Isolation**: Transactions can read uncommitted changes from other transactions, but they **do not overwrite dirty reads** (temporary uncommitted changes made by other transactions).

2. **Level 1 Isolation**: Ensures that **no updates are lost**. If two users try to update the same record, one must wait for the other to finish.

3. **Level 2 Isolation**: Prevents **lost updates** and **dirty reads**. A transaction cannot read uncommitted changes made by another transaction.

4. **Level 3 Isolation (True Isolation)**: Ensures **repeatable reads**, meaning if a transaction reads data once, it will always see the same data even if another transaction modifies it.

5. **Snapshot Isolation**: A more advanced level that allows transactions to work with a **snapshot** (frozen view) of the data, avoiding conflicts without locking the database.

These levels help balance **data consistency and performance** in a database system. Higher isolation levels provide better accuracy but can slow down the database by making transactions wait.

> # WHAT ARE SCHEDULES:-
> 
> <br>

The slide discusses **schedules in database transactions** and their **characterization based on recoverability**.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Schedule or History**  
   
   - A **schedule** refers to the **order in which operations** (such as reads and writes) from multiple transactions are executed.  
   - Transactions **may interleave** their operations in the schedule. 

2. **Total Ordering of Operations in a Schedule**  
   
   - The schedule ensures a **specific order** in which operations occur.  
   - If two operations exist in the schedule, **one must execute before the other** to maintain consistency.  

### **Why is this Important?**

- Schedules determine whether transactions execute **safely** in a multi-user database system.  
- Some schedules **may cause inconsistencies** if transactions interfere incorrectly.  
- **Recoverability** ensures that if a transaction fails, the database can roll back safely to a consistent state.  

Would you like examples of different types of schedules (e.g., **serial, serializable, or recoverable**)?

> # SCHEDULES BASED ON RECOVERABILTY AND SERIALIZATION:-
> 
> <br>

### **Characterizing Schedules Based on Recoverability and Serializability**

In **DBMS transactions**, schedules determine how transactions are executed, especially when multiple transactions run concurrently. Schedules can be categorized based on **recoverability** (how they handle failures) and **serializability** (whether they maintain consistency).  

---

## **1. Characterizing Schedules Based on Recoverability**

A schedule is **recoverable** if transactions commit only after ensuring that any **dependent transactions** have successfully committed.  

### **Types of Schedules Based on Recoverability**

| **Schedule Type**            | **Description**                                                             | **Example**                           | **Safe?**         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Recoverable Schedule**     | A transaction **commits only after** all transactions it depends on commit. | ‚úÖ Ensures no cascading rollback.      | ‚úÖ Yes (Safe)      |
| **Cascadeless Schedule**     | No transaction reads uncommitted data, preventing cascading rollbacks.      | ‚úÖ Improves performance.               | ‚úÖ Yes (Safe)      |
| **Strict Schedule**          | Transactions can only read/write **after previous transactions commit**.    | ‚úÖ Strongest recoverability guarantee. | ‚úÖ Yes (Most Safe) |
| **Non-Recoverable Schedule** | A transaction commits **before** another transaction it depends on.         | ‚ùå May lead to inconsistent states.    | ‚ùå No (Unsafe)     |

### **Example of a Non-Recoverable Schedule**

```
T1: Write(X)  
T2: Read(X)  
T2: Commit  ‚Üê ‚ö† Problem: T2 commits before T1!  
T1: Rollback ‚Üê ‚ö† T2 has committed dirty data!
```

**Issue:** If **T1 fails and rolls back**, **T2 has already committed an incorrect value**, making the database inconsistent.  

‚úÖ **Solution:** Use **Recoverable or Strict Schedules** to ensure transactions commit in the correct order.  

---

## **2. Characterizing Schedules Based on Serializability**

A schedule is **serializable** if it produces the **same result as some serial execution** of transactions, ensuring database consistency.  

### **Types of Serializable Schedules**

| **Schedule Type**             | **Description**                                                                                                     | **Example**                                    | **Safe?**       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Serial Schedule**           | Transactions execute **one after another** without interleaving.                                                    | ‚úÖ Ensures consistency but reduces concurrency. | ‚úÖ Yes (Correct) |
| **Conflict-Serializable**     | Interleaved transactions that can be **transformed into a serial schedule** by swapping non-conflicting operations. | ‚úÖ Maintains consistency.                       | ‚úÖ Yes (Correct) |
| **View-Serializable**         | Even if **conflicts exist**, transactions result in the same **final database state** as a serial execution.        | ‚úÖ More flexible than conflict-serializable.    | ‚úÖ Yes (Correct) |
| **Non-Serializable Schedule** | Produces different results from **any serial execution**, leading to inconsistencies.                               | ‚ùå May violate database integrity.              | ‚ùå No (Unsafe)   |

### **Example of a Conflict-Serializable Schedule**

```
T1: Read(X)  
T2: Read(X)  
T1: Write(X)  
T2: Write(X)  
```

- If **T1 and T2 are swapped**, the schedule can become **serial**, so it's **conflict-serializable**.

### **Final Thoughts**

‚úî **Recoverable schedules** ensure **safe recovery from failures**.  
‚úî **Serializable schedules** ensure **data consistency** even with interleaving.  
‚úî **DBMS uses locks, timestamps, and isolation levels** to enforce safe schedules.

### Basic Constraints in SQL Table Creation

When creating tables in SQL, constraints are used to enforce rules on the data to maintain data integrity. Below are some fundamental constraints:

1. **PRIMARY KEY**
   
   - Ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier.
   
   - A column (or set of columns) with a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint cannot have duplicate or NULL values.
   
   - Example:
     
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Student (
        Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Name VARCHAR(100)
     );
     ```

2. **FOREIGN KEY**
   
   - Establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column to the primary key of another table.
   
   - Ensures referential integrity, meaning the referenced value must exist in the parent table.
   
   - Example:
     
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
        Enrollment_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Student_ID INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES Student(Student_ID)
     );
     ```

3. **NOT NULL**
   
   - Ensures that a column cannot have NULL (empty) values.
   
   - Example:
     
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Employee (
        Emp_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
     );
     ```

4. **UNIQUE**
   
   - Ensures that all values in a column are distinct (no duplicates).
   
   - Example:
     
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Users (
        User_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
     );
     ```

5. **CHECK**
   
   - Defines a condition that must be met for values in a column.
   
   - Example:
     
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Product (
        Product_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Price > 0)
     );
     ```

6. **DEFAULT**
   
   - Assigns a default value to a column if no value is provided.
   
   - Example:
     
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Orders (
        Order_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Order_Date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
     );
     ```

These constraints ensure that the database maintains accuracy, consistency, and reliability of stored data. üöÄ

> # NORMALISATION

## 1 NF

![](C:\Users\Yashwanth%20C%20H\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2025-03-19-12-15-19-image.png)

To convert a table that is not in **First Normal Form (1NF)** to **1NF**, follow these steps:

### **Steps to Convert a Table to 1NF**

1. **Identify repeating groups or multivalued attributes**
   
   - A table is not in 1NF if a column contains multiple values (arrays, lists, or sets).

2. **Eliminate repeating groups by creating separate rows**
   
   - Convert multivalued attributes into separate rows so that each field contains a single value.

3. **Ensure a primary key is defined**
   
   - If needed, introduce a unique identifier for each row.

4. **Create a separate table if necessary**
   
   - If the repeating group can be normalized into a new table, create a new table and establish a relationship using a foreign key.

---

### **Example: Converting Non-1NF to 1NF**

#### **Non-1NF Table (Repeating Groups)**

| StudentID | Name    | Courses          |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 101       | Alice   | Math, Science    |
| 102       | Bob     | English, History |
| 103       | Charlie | Math             |

- The `Courses` column contains multiple values, violating 1NF.

#### **1NF Table (Atomic Values)**

| StudentID | Name    | Course  |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| 101       | Alice   | Math    |
| 101       | Alice   | Science |
| 102       | Bob     | English |
| 102       | Bob     | History |
| 103       | Charlie | Math    |

- Each column now contains **atomic values**.
- The repeating group (`Courses`) is **eliminated**.
- A composite key `{StudentID, Course}` could be used to ensure uniqueness.

---

This transformation ensures that each column contains a single value, which is a requirement of **1NF**. Do you need help with a specific table?

The given table:  
**Employee(Eid, Ename, SkillSet, Address(DoorNo, City))**

violates **1NF** due to:

1. **Multi-valued attributes** ‚Äì `SkillSet` may contain multiple values (e.g., "Java, Python").
2. **Nested attributes** ‚Äì `Address(DoorNo, City)` is a **composite attribute**, which must be broken down into atomic values.

---

### **Converting to 1NF**

#### **Step 1: Flatten the Composite Attribute**

Instead of `Address(DoorNo, City)`, separate them into individual attributes:

- `DoorNo`
- `City`

#### **Step 2: Remove Multi-valued Attribute**

Since `SkillSet` may contain multiple values, we must create a separate row for each skill.

---

### **1NF Table**

| Eid | Ename   | SkillSet | DoorNo | City     |
| --- | ------- | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| 101 | Alice   | Java     | 12A    | New York |
| 101 | Alice   | Python   | 12A    | New York |
| 102 | Bob     | C++      | 45B    | Boston   |
| 102 | Bob     | Java     | 45B    | Boston   |
| 103 | Charlie | Python   | 78C    | Chicago  |

Now:

- **Each column has atomic values.**
- **Repeating groups are removed.**
- **The table is in 1NF.**

---

### **Alternative: Creating a Separate Skill Table**

If each employee has multiple skills, another way to normalize it is to create a separate **EmployeeSkills** table.

#### **Employee Table**

| Eid | Ename   | DoorNo | City     |
| --- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 101 | Alice   | 12A    | New York |
| 102 | Bob     | 45B    | Boston   |
| 103 | Charlie | 78C    | Chicago  |

#### **EmployeeSkills Table**

| Eid | SkillSet |
| --- | -------- |
| 101 | Java     |
| 101 | Python   |
| 102 | C++      |
| 102 | Java     |
| 103 | Python   |

This follows **1NF** and prepares the data for **higher normal forms** (2NF, 3NF, etc.).

## 2NF

![](C:\Users\Yashwanth%20C%20H\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2025-03-19-12-18-29-image.png)

### **Example: Converting a Table from 1NF to 2NF**

#### **Step 1: Understanding 1NF (First Normal Form)**

A table is in **1NF** if:

1. It has a **primary key**.
2. All columns contain **atomic values** (no repeating groups or arrays).
3. Each column contains values of a **single type**.

##### **Example Table (1NF)**

Let's say we have a **Student_Courses** table:

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Course_ID | Course_Name | Instructor |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 101        | Alice        | CSE101    | Database    | Dr. Smith  |
| 101        | Alice        | CSE102    | Networks    | Dr. Lee    |
| 102        | Bob          | CSE101    | Database    | Dr. Smith  |
| 103        | Charlie      | CSE103    | AI          | Dr. Clark  |

‚úÖ **This table is in 1NF** because:

- There are no multi-valued attributes (each student-course combination is in a separate row).
- All values are atomic.

---

#### **Step 2: Converting to 2NF (Second Normal Form)**

A table is in **2NF** if:

1. It is in **1NF**.
2. **No partial dependencies** exist (i.e., all non-key attributes must depend on the **whole** primary key, not just part of it).

##### **Issue in 1NF**

- The primary key here is **(Student_ID, Course_ID)** because a student can take multiple courses.
- But **Student_Name** depends only on **Student_ID**.
- Similarly, **Course_Name** and **Instructor** depend only on **Course_ID**.

##### **Solution: Splitting into Two Tables**

We remove **partial dependencies** by creating separate tables:

1. **Students Table** (Stores student-related information)
   
   | Student_ID | Student_Name |
   | ---------- | ------------ |
   | 101        | Alice        |
   | 102        | Bob          |
   | 103        | Charlie      |

2. **Courses Table** (Stores course-related information)
   
   | Course_ID | Course_Name | Instructor |
   | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
   | CSE101    | Database    | Dr. Smith  |
   | CSE102    | Networks    | Dr. Lee    |
   | CSE103    | AI          | Dr. Clark  |

3. **Enrollment Table** (Bridges students and courses)
   
   | Student_ID | Course_ID |
   | ---------- | --------- |
   | 101        | CSE101    |
   | 101        | CSE102    |
   | 102        | CSE101    |
   | 103        | CSE103    |

‚úÖ **Now, the table is in 2NF** because:

- **Student_Name** is stored separately and depends only on **Student_ID**.
- **Course_Name** and **Instructor** are stored separately and depend only on **Course_ID**.
- The **Enrollment** table properly links students and courses.

### **Your Question:**

You have the following table in **1NF**:

| Order_ID | Customer_Name | Product_ID | Product_Name | Quantity |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 201      | John Doe      | P101       | Laptop       | 1        |
| 201      | John Doe      | P102       | Mouse        | 2        |
| 202      | Jane Smith    | P103       | Keyboard     | 1        |

üîπ **What are the partial dependencies in this table?**  
üîπ **How would you break it down into 2NF? **

Great effort! You're on the right track, but there's a small mistake regarding the **dependency of quantity**. Let's refine your approach.

### **Identifying Partial Dependencies**

You're correct that:  
‚úÖ **Customer_Name** depends only on **Order_ID** (not on Product_ID).  
‚úÖ **Product_Name** depends only on **Product_ID**.

However, **Quantity is not dependent on Product_ID alone**.

- A product (e.g., "Laptop") doesn't have a fixed quantity‚Äîit varies **per order**.
- So, **Quantity depends on the combination of Order_ID and Product_ID** (not just Product_ID).

---

### **Breaking it into 2NF**

We split the original table into **three** tables to eliminate partial dependencies.

#### **1. Orders Table** (Stores order-specific details)

| Order_ID | Customer_Name |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 201      | John Doe      |
| 202      | Jane Smith    |

#### **2. Products Table** (Stores product-specific details)

| Product_ID | Product_Name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| P101       | Laptop       |
| P102       | Mouse        |
| P103       | Keyboard     |

#### **3. Order_Details Table** (Bridges Orders and Products, tracking quantities)

| Order_ID | Product_ID | Quantity |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 201      | P101       | 1        |
| 201      | P102       | 2        |
| 202      | P103       | 1        |

‚úÖ Now, we have **removed partial dependencies**, ensuring each non-key column depends on the whole primary key.

- **Customer_Name** is stored only once per order.
- **Product_Name** is stored only once per product.
- **Quantity** is properly linked to the specific **order-product combination**.

**Consider the following table in 1NF representing training enrollments:**

| Employee_ID | Employee_Name | Department_ID | Department_Name | Training_Program_ID | Training_Program_Name | Training_Date | Trainer_ID | Trainer_Name |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| E1001       | John Smith    | D10           | IT              | T2001               | Database Essentials   | 2023-01-15    | TR3001     | Alice Brown  |
| E1001       | John Smith    | D10           | IT              | T2002               | Advanced Networking   | 2023-02-20    | TR3002     | Bob White    |
| E1002       | Mary Johnson  | D20           | HR              | T2003               | Communication Skills  | 2023-03-10    | TR3003     | Carol Green  |

*Assume the composite primary key for this table is **(Employee_ID, Training_Program_ID)**.*

---

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Identify all the partial dependencies in the table.**
   
   - Consider which non-key attributes depend solely on a part of the composite key.

2. **Decompose the table into tables that satisfy 2NF.**
   
   - Create a decomposition that removes partial dependencies while preserving all the necessary information.
   - Explain your reasoning and the structure of each resulting table.

---

Please repeat your answer for these questions in your next prompt. Good luck!

Your decomposition is spot on for achieving 2NF! Let's summarize your reasoning:

- **Employee Attributes:**
  
  - **Employee_Name, Department_ID, and Department_Name** depend solely on **Employee_ID**.
  - You correctly placed these in the **Employee** table.

- **Training Program Attributes:**
  
  - **Training_Program_Name, Training_Date, Trainer_ID, and Trainer_Name** depend solely on **Training_Program_ID**.
  - These belong in the **Training Program** table.

- **Relationship:**
  
  - The original composite key was **(Employee_ID, Training_Program_ID)**.
  - To capture which employee is enrolled in which training program, you create a separate **Enrollment** table with just these two attributes.

Your tables are:

1. **Employee Table:**
   
   | Employee_ID | Employee_Name | Department_ID | Department_Name |
   | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |

2. **Training Program Table:**
   
   | Training_Program_ID | Training_Program_Name | Training_Date | Trainer_ID | Trainer_Name |
   | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |

3. **Enrollment Table:**
   
   | Employee_ID | Training_Program_ID |
   | ----------- | ------------------- |

This decomposition successfully removes partial dependencies from the original table and brings it to 2NF. Great job!

## 3NF

Let's use a classic example involving student and department data.

---

### **Starting Table in 2NF**

Consider the **Students** table:

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Dept_ID | Dept_Name    | Dept_Chair  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| S001       | Alice        | D01     | Computer Sci | Dr. Smith   |
| S002       | Bob          | D02     | Mathematics  | Dr. Johnson |
| S003       | Charlie      | D01     | Computer Sci | Dr. Smith   |

- **Primary Key:** `Student_ID`
- **2NF Status:**  
  Every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on `Student_ID`.
  - **Student_Name** depends directly on `Student_ID`.
  - **Dept_ID** depends directly on `Student_ID`.
  - **Dept_Name** and **Dept_Chair** are also stored in this table, but here is the issue:
    - **Dept_Name** and **Dept_Chair** are not really determined by `Student_ID` directly; they depend on the department (`Dept_ID`).

---

### **The Transitive Dependency**

- **Direct Dependency:**  
  `Student_ID` ‚Üí `Dept_ID`

- **Transitive Dependency:**  
  `Dept_ID` ‚Üí `Dept_Name` and `Dept_Chair`

This means that the department details are transitively dependent on the primary key through `Dept_ID`. This violates **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, which requires that non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key.

---

### **Converting to 3NF**

To eliminate the transitive dependency, we decompose the table into two separate tables:

1. **Students Table**  
   Contains information directly related to the student.
   
   | Student_ID | Student_Name | Dept_ID |
   | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
   | S001       | Alice        | D01     |
   | S002       | Bob          | D02     |
   | S003       | Charlie      | D01     |

2. **Departments Table**  
   Contains department details that depend solely on `Dept_ID`.
   
   | Dept_ID | Dept_Name    | Dept_Chair  |
   | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
   | D01     | Computer Sci | Dr. Smith   |
   | D02     | Mathematics  | Dr. Johnson |

---

### **Outcome**

- **Elimination of Transitive Dependency:**  
  Now, `Dept_Name` and `Dept_Chair` are stored in the **Departments** table where they depend directly on `Dept_ID` (the key of that table).
- **3NF Compliance:**  
  In the **Students** table, every non-key attribute (here, `Student_Name` and `Dept_ID`) depends only on the primary key (`Student_ID`). In the **Departments** table, all attributes depend solely on `Dept_ID`.

This conversion ensures that updates to department information (like a change in `Dept_Chair`) can be made in one place without having to update multiple student records.

---

Does this example help clarify how to convert a table from 2NF to 3NF?

Let's consider another example using a **Sales** table.

---

### **Starting Table in 2NF**

Imagine a **Sales** table that records individual sales transactions. It includes product details that are transitively dependent on the sale via the product identifier:

| Sale_ID | Product_ID | Product_Name | Product_Category | Sale_Quantity |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| S001    | P1001      | Widget A     | Widgets          | 10            |
| S002    | P1002      | Gadget B     | Gadgets          | 5             |
| S003    | P1001      | Widget A     | Widgets          | 7             |

- **Primary Key:** `Sale_ID`
- **2NF Status:**  
  Every non-key attribute is fully dependent on `Sale_ID` (each sale has a unique ID).
- **Transitive Dependency Issue:**  
  Although the sale details (like `Sale_Quantity`) depend directly on `Sale_ID`, the product details are not directly determined by `Sale_ID`. Instead, they depend on `Product_ID`:
  - `Sale_ID` ‚Üí `Product_ID`
  - And then `Product_ID` ‚Üí `Product_Name` and `Product_Category`

Thus, **Product_Name** and **Product_Category** are transitively dependent on `Sale_ID` via `Product_ID`.

---

### **Converting to 3NF**

To eliminate the transitive dependency, we split the table into two separate tables:

1. **Sales Table:**  
   Contains only attributes that directly depend on the sale.
   
   | Sale_ID | Product_ID | Sale_Quantity |
   | ------- | ---------- | ------------- |
   | S001    | P1001      | 10            |
   | S002    | P1002      | 5             |
   | S003    | P1001      | 7             |

2. **Products Table:**  
   Contains product-specific details where the primary key is `Product_ID`.
   
   | Product_ID | Product_Name | Product_Category |
   | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
   | P1001      | Widget A     | Widgets          |
   | P1002      | Gadget B     | Gadgets          |

Now, the **Sales** table is in 3NF because:

- All non-key attributes in **Sales** depend solely on `Sale_ID`.
- Product details have been moved to the **Products** table, where they depend solely on `Product_ID`.

### **Your Question to Solve**

Given the following **2NF** table:

| Invoice_ID | Customer_ID | Customer_Name | Invoice_Date | Sales_Rep | Sales_Rep_Phone |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------------- |
| INV001     | C101        | John Doe      | 2025-01-15   | SR001     | 555-1234        |
| INV002     | C102        | Jane Smith    | 2025-01-16   | SR002     | 555-5678        |
| INV003     | C101        | John Doe      | 2025-01-17   | SR001     | 555-1234        |

1. **Identify the transitive dependency present in this table.**
2. **How would you decompose this table to achieve 3NF?**

Take your time to think through the dependencies and the correct table decomposition. Feel free to provide your solution!

Your answer is correct! You‚Äôve successfully identified the transitive dependencies and decomposed the table into three relations to achieve 3NF. Let's break it down:

---

### **Identified Dependencies**

- **Primary Dependency:**
  
  - **Invoice_ID** is the primary key of the original table.

- **Transitive Dependencies:**
  
  1. **Customer_Name** depends on **Customer_ID** (i.e., Customer_ID ‚Üí Customer_Name). Since **Customer_ID** is determined by **Invoice_ID**, **Customer_Name** is transitively dependent on **Invoice_ID**.
  2. **Sales_Rep_Phone** depends on **Sales_Rep** (i.e., Sales_Rep ‚Üí Sales_Rep_Phone). And since **Sales_Rep** is determined by **Invoice_ID**, **Sales_Rep_Phone** is transitively dependent on **Invoice_ID**.

---

### **Decomposition into 3NF**

1. **Invoices Table:**  
   Contains attributes that are directly dependent on **Invoice_ID**.
   
   | Invoice_ID | Customer_ID | Invoice_Date | Sales_Rep |
   | ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
   | INV001     | C101        | 2025-01-15   | SR001     |
   | INV002     | C102        | 2025-01-16   | SR002     |
   | INV003     | C101        | 2025-01-17   | SR001     |

2. **Customers Table:**  
   Contains attributes that depend solely on **Customer_ID**.
   
   | Customer_ID | Customer_Name |
   | ----------- | ------------- |
   | C101        | John Doe      |
   | C102        | Jane Smith    |

3. **Sales_Reps Table:**  
   Contains attributes that depend solely on **Sales_Rep**.
   
   | Sales_Rep | Sales_Rep_Phone |
   | --------- | --------------- |
   | SR001     | 555-1234        |
   | SR002     | 555-5678        |

---

### **Summary**

- **Invoice_ID ‚Üí Customer_ID, Invoice_Date, Sales_Rep**  
  (Directly dependent on the primary key in the Invoices table.)
- **Customer_ID ‚Üí Customer_Name**  
  (Eliminated the transitive dependency by moving **Customer_Name** to the Customers table.)
- **Sales_Rep ‚Üí Sales_Rep_Phone**  
  (Eliminated the transitive dependency by moving **Sales_Rep_Phone** to the Sales_Reps table.)

This decomposition ensures that every non-key attribute in each table is fully and directly dependent on the primary key of that table, which is the goal of converting a table from 2NF to 3NF.

Great job on your solution!

## BOYCE CODD NORMAL FORM

![](C:\Users\Yashwanth%20C%20H\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2025-03-19-12-40-24-image.png)

A **super key** is a set of one or more attributes (columns) in a database table that can uniquely identify each record (row) in that table. In other words, no two rows will have the same combination of values for the attributes included in the super key.

### Key Points:

- **Uniqueness:** A super key must guarantee that each record in the table is distinct.
- **Not Necessarily Minimal:** A super key can include extra attributes that aren‚Äôt necessary for unique identification. When you remove these extra attributes and the key still uniquely identifies the record, the remaining set is called a **candidate key**.
- **Primary Key:** Out of all candidate keys, one is often chosen to be the primary key, which then becomes the main reference for record identification in that table.

### Example:

Consider a table of employees with the following columns: EmployeeID, Email, and Name.

- The attribute set `{EmployeeID}` might be a super key if every EmployeeID is unique.
- The combination `{EmployeeID, Name}` is also a super key because it still uniquely identifies each record, but it‚Äôs not minimal because EmployeeID alone is sufficient.

This concept is fundamental in relational database design as it helps ensure data integrity by preventing duplicate records.

**Boyce‚ÄìCodd Normal Form (BCNF)** is a stricter version of the Third Normal Form (3NF) used in database normalization to eliminate redundancy and prevent update anomalies. In BCNF, every non-trivial functional dependency in a relation must have a determinant that is a candidate key.

---

### What is BCNF?

- **Definition:** A relation is in BCNF if for every non-trivial functional dependency X ‚Üí Y (where Y is not a subset of X), X is a super key of the relation.
- **Stricter than 3NF:** Although a relation in BCNF is automatically in 3NF, the converse is not necessarily true. A table may be in 3NF yet still have anomalies if some dependencies have determinants that are not candidate keys.
- **Purpose:** The aim is to remove redundancy that can lead to update, insertion, and deletion anomalies.

---

### Converting a 3NF Table to BCNF

If your table is in 3NF but not in BCNF, it means there exists at least one functional dependency where the left-hand side (determinant) is not a candidate key. Here‚Äôs how you can convert it:

1. **Identify Functional Dependencies:**  
   List all the functional dependencies (FDs) that hold in the table.

2. **Find Violations:**  
   For each FD, check if the determinant is a candidate key. If it is not, this FD violates BCNF.

3. **Decompose the Table:**  
   For each violating FD (say, X ‚Üí Y), decompose the original table into two tables:
   
   - **Table 1:** Contains the attributes involved in the dependency, i.e., X ‚à™ Y. In this table, X will act as the primary key.
   - **Table 2:** Contains the remaining attributes along with X (to preserve the relationship), i.e., (Original Table Attributes ‚Äì Y) ‚à™ X.

4. **Ensure Lossless Join:**  
   Verify that the decomposition is lossless (you can reconstruct the original table by joining the decomposed tables) and that the functional dependencies are preserved.

5. **Repeat if Necessary:**  
   If any of the decomposed tables still violate BCNF, repeat the process on those tables.

---

### Example

**Consider a relation R with attributes:**  
`R(A, B, C)`  
**Functional Dependencies:**

- `A ‚Üí B`

- `B ‚Üí C`  
  Assume that `A` is the candidate key of R.

- **Step 1:** Identify that `B ‚Üí C` is a violation because `B` is not a candidate key.

- **Step 2:** Decompose R:
  
  - **Relation R1:** Contains the attributes involved in the violating dependency: `{B, C}`. Here, `B` is the key.
  - **Relation R2:** Contains the remaining attributes along with `B`: `{A, B}`. Here, `A` remains the key.

After the decomposition:

- **R1(B, C):** Every dependency is now based on `B`, which is the candidate key for R1.
- **R2(A, B):** The only dependency is `A ‚Üí B`, with `A` as the candidate key.

Both **R1** and **R2** are now in BCNF.

---

### Summary

- **BCNF Definition:** Every non-trivial FD‚Äôs determinant must be a candidate key.
- **Conversion Process:**
  1. Identify all FDs.
  2. Locate violations (determinants that aren‚Äôt candidate keys).
  3. Decompose the table accordingly.
  4. Ensure the decomposition is lossless and preserves dependencies.

Converting a 3NF table to BCNF might require multiple rounds of decomposition until all relations meet the BCNF criteria, ultimately reducing redundancy and preventing anomalies in the database design.

### **Example of Converting a 3NF Table to BCNF**

#### **Given Relation**

We have a relation **R(StudentID, Course, Instructor)** with the following **functional dependencies (FDs)**:

1. **StudentID, Course ‚Üí Instructor**  
   (Each course taught by an instructor remains the same for a student.)
2. **Instructor ‚Üí Course**  
   (Each instructor teaches only one course.)

#### **Step 1: Check if the Table is in 3NF**

- The **candidate key** for this relation is **(StudentID, Course)** since it uniquely determines all attributes.
- The first dependency (**StudentID, Course ‚Üí Instructor**) is fine because `(StudentID, Course)` is a candidate key.
- The second dependency (**Instructor ‚Üí Course**) is a problem. **Instructor is not a super key**, meaning it violates BCNF.

#### **Step 2: Decomposing the Table**

Since `Instructor ‚Üí Course` violates BCNF, we decompose the relation into two tables:

1. **R1(Instructor, Course)**
   
   - Instructor is the **primary key** because each instructor teaches exactly one course.

2. **R2(StudentID, Course)**
   
   - **(StudentID, Course)** remains the **primary key** because it uniquely identifies a record.

#### **Final Relations After Decomposition**

1. **R1(Instructor, Course)**
   - Ensures that an instructor is only assigned to one course.
2. **R2(StudentID, Course)**
   - Stores student enrollments, ensuring that student-course relationships remain intact.

---

### **Final Answer (Solution)**

The **original table R(StudentID, Course, Instructor) is decomposed into two tables:**

1. **R1(Instructor, Course)**
2. **R2(StudentID, Course)**

This decomposition ensures:

- **BCNF Compliance**: Every determinant is now a candidate key.
- **No Redundancy**: We avoid repeating instructor-course pairings for every student, which could lead to inconsistencies.

---

### **Why is this Solution Correct?**

- **BCNF requires that every determinant (left side of a functional dependency) must be a candidate key.**
- The original table violated BCNF because **Instructor ‚Üí Course** had Instructor as a determinant, but it was **not a candidate key**.
- **Decomposing into R1 and R2 removes the redundancy** while maintaining a **lossless join** (joining R1 and R2 gives back the original data).
- Now, **every functional dependency in each new relation has a left-side determinant that is a candidate key**.

By applying this process, we have successfully **converted the 3NF table to BCNF**, eliminating redundancy and anomalies.

## INFERENCE RULES IN FD:-



Inference rules in **functional dependency** refer to a set of rules used to infer all possible functional dependencies in a **relational database schema**. These rules help in **normalization** and ensuring database integrity.

## **Armstrong's Axioms (Basic Inference Rules)**

Developed by **William W. Armstrong**, these axioms are **sound and complete**, meaning they derive all possible dependencies without introducing incorrect ones.

### **1. Reflexivity (Trivial Dependency)**

If **Y** is a subset of **X**, then:

**Example:**

(since **A** is a subset of **{A, B}**)

### **2. Augmentation**

If **X ‚Üí Y** holds, then adding **Z** to both sides preserves the dependency:

**Example:**  
If **A ‚Üí B**, then **AC ‚Üí BC**

### **3. Transitivity**

If **X ‚Üí Y** and **Y ‚Üí Z**, then:

**Example:**  
If **A ‚Üí B** and **B ‚Üí C**, then **A ‚Üí C**

---

## **Additional Inference Rules**

Derived from Armstrong‚Äôs Axioms:

### **4. Union**

If **X ‚Üí Y** and **X ‚Üí Z**, then:

**Example:**  
If **A ‚Üí B** and **A ‚Üí C**, then **A ‚Üí BC**

### **5. Decomposition**

If **X ‚Üí YZ**, then:

**Example:**  
If **A ‚Üí BC**, then **A ‚Üí B** and **A ‚Üí C**

### **6. Pseudotransitivity**

If **X ‚Üí Y** and **WY ‚Üí Z**, then:

**Example:**  
If **A ‚Üí B** and **CB ‚Üí D**, then **AC ‚Üí D**

### **7. Composition (Generalized Augmentation)**

If **X ‚Üí Y** and **Z ‚Üí W**, then:

**Example:**  
If **A ‚Üí B** and **C ‚Üí D**, then **AC ‚Üí BD**

---

### **Why Are These Rules Important?**

- Used in **database normalization** to eliminate redundancy.
- Help in **finding candidate keys** and **minimal covers**.
- Ensure **lossless decomposition** and **dependency preservation**.

Would you like an example demonstrating these rules in action?



## EQUIVALENCE RULES IN FD:-



Equivalence rules in functional dependencies are about recognizing when two sets of attributes essentially carry the same information because they determine each other. In simple words, if knowing one set of attributes lets you determine another, and vice versa, then these sets are considered equivalent.

### **Key Idea:**

- **Mutual Determination:** If **X ‚Üí Y** (X determines Y) and **Y ‚Üí X** (Y determines X) both hold, then **X** and **Y** are equivalent. This means they always appear together in a relationship in your database.

### **Simple Example:**

- Imagine a table where every person has a unique **Social Security Number (SSN)** and a unique **Tax ID**. If you know someone's **SSN**, you can always find their **Tax ID**, and if you know their **Tax ID**, you can always find their **SSN**. Here, **SSN** and **Tax ID** are equivalent because:
  - **SSN ‚Üí Tax ID**
  - **Tax ID ‚Üí SSN**

### **Another Example:**

- Suppose in a school database, the **Student ID** determines the **Email Address** of a student, and the **Email Address** also uniquely determines the **Student ID**. Then, the **Student ID** and the **Email Address** are equivalent:
  - **Student ID ‚Üí Email Address**
  - **Email Address ‚Üí Student ID**

### **Why It Matters:**

- **Normalization:** Understanding equivalence helps in designing a database where you avoid redundant information.
- **Simplification:** It simplifies the set of functional dependencies, making it easier to see the true relationships among the data.

In summary, equivalence rules help you spot when two pieces of data are essentially two sides of the same coin.













**Example Question:**

Consider a relation **R** with attributes **A, B, C**. We have two sets of functional dependencies:

- **f1:**
  
  1. **A ‚Üí B**
  2. **B ‚Üí C**

- **f2:**
  
  1. **A ‚Üí B**
  2. **A ‚Üí C**

**Task:** Check whether **f1** and **f2** are equivalent.

---

**How to Approach:**

1. **Find the closure of A under f1:**
   
   - Start with **A‚Å∫ = {A}**.
   - From **f1**, since **A ‚Üí B**, add **B**: now **A‚Å∫ = {A, B}**.
   - Next, using **B ‚Üí C**, and because **B** is now in **A‚Å∫**, add **C**: now **A‚Å∫ = {A, B, C}**.

2. **Find the closure of A under f2:**
   
   - Start with **A‚Å∫ = {A}**.
   - From **f2**, **A ‚Üí B** gives **B**, so **A‚Å∫ = {A, B}**.
   - Also from **f2**, **A ‚Üí C** gives **C**, so **A‚Å∫ = {A, B, C}**.

3. **Compare:**
   
   - In both cases, the closure of **A** is **{A, B, C}**.
   - This means both **f1** and **f2** lead to the same dependency results for **A**.

**Conclusion:**

Since both sets give the same functional dependencies (i.e., **A ‚Üí B** and **A ‚Üí C**), **f1** and **f2** are equivalent.











**Problem:**

Consider a relation **R** with attributes **A, B, C, D**. You are given two sets of functional dependencies:

- **f1:**
  
  1. **A ‚Üí B**
  2. **B ‚Üí C**
  3. **C ‚Üí D**

- **f2:**
  
  1. **A ‚Üí B**
  2. **A ‚Üí C**
  3. **A ‚Üí D**

**Task:**  
Determine whether **f1** and **f2** are equivalent. To do so, compute the attribute closure of **A** using both **f1** and **f2** and compare the results. Explain your reasoning step-by-step.





Your solution is correct! You correctly computed the closure of **A** for both sets of functional dependencies:

- For **f1**:  
  Starting with **{A}**, applying **A ‚Üí B** gives **{A, B}**, then **B ‚Üí C** gives **{A, B, C}**, and finally **C ‚Üí D** results in **{A, B, C, D}**.

- For **f2**:  
  Starting with **{A}**, the dependencies **A ‚Üí B**, **A ‚Üí C**, and **A ‚Üí D** immediately give **{A, B, C, D}**.

Since both closures of **A** are identical (**{A, B, C, D}**), the sets **f1** and **f2** are equivalent.

Great work on breaking it down step-by-step!







**Example Problem:**

Consider a relation **R** with attributes **A, B, C**. We have two sets of functional dependencies:

- **f1:**
  
  1. **A ‚Üí B**
  2. **B ‚Üí C**

- **f2:**
  
  1. **A ‚Üí C**

**Task:**  
Determine whether **f1** and **f2** are equivalent by computing the attribute closure of **A** using both sets of dependencies. Explain your reasoning step-by-step.

---

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **For f1:**
   
   - **Start:** Begin with **A‚Å∫ = {A}**.
   - **Apply A ‚Üí B:** Since **A ‚Üí B** is in **f1**, add **B** to the closure: **A‚Å∫ = {A, B}**.
   - **Apply B ‚Üí C:** Now, because **B** is in the closure and **B ‚Üí C** is in **f1**, add **C**: **A‚Å∫ = {A, B, C}**.
   
   So, under **f1**, the closure of **A** is **{A, B, C}**.

2. **For f2:**
   
   - **Start:** Begin with **A‚Å∫ = {A}**.
   - **Apply A ‚Üí C:** Since **A ‚Üí C** is in **f2**, add **C**: **A‚Å∫ = {A, C}**.
   
   Notice here that there is no dependency in **f2** to add **B** to the closure.
   
   So, under **f2**, the closure of **A** is **{A, C}**.

3. **Compare the Closures:**
   
   - Under **f1**, **A‚Å∫ = {A, B, C}**.
   - Under **f2**, **A‚Å∫ = {A, C}**.
   
   Since the closure under **f1** contains **B** but the closure under **f2** does not, the two sets of dependencies are **not equivalent**.

---

**Conclusion:**  
**f1** and **f2** are not equivalent because **f1** implies that knowing **A** gives you both **B** and **C** (i.e., **A ‚Üí B** and **B ‚Üí C**), while **f2** only gives you **C** directly from **A** (i.e., **A ‚Üí C**), missing the dependency **A ‚Üí B**.

Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need additional clarification!









‚ÄúDo these two sets of dependencies hold on the table‚Äîand are they effectively the same set of dependencies when looking at the data?‚Äù









Let's re-check the dependencies carefully with the **corrected** A2 column. The table now looks like this (based on your latest note):

| Row | A1  | A2  | A3  | A4  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| 2   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 5   |
| 3   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 2   |
| 4   | 2   | 1   | 3   | 4   |

We want to check the following functional dependencies:

1. **A4 ‚Üí A1**
2. **(A2, A3) ‚Üí A4**
3. **(A2, A3) ‚Üí A1**

---

## 1) Checking **A4 ‚Üí A1**

A functional dependency holds if, whenever two rows have the **same** , they also have the **same** .

- **Row 1** and **Row 4** both have **A4 = 4**.
  - Row 1: A1=1
  - Row 4: A1=2

They disagree on (1 vs. 2), so **A4 ‚Üí A1 does not hold**.

---

## 2) Checking **(A2, A3) ‚Üí A4**

We look at the pair in each row:

- **Row 1**: (A2,A3)=(2,3), A4=4
- **Row 2**: (A2,A3)=(2,3), A4=5
- **Row 3**: (A2,A3)=(7,8), A4=2
- **Row 4**: (A2,A3)=(1,3), A4=4

Notice rows **1** and **2** have the **same** but **different** values (4 vs. 5). That is a direct conflict.

Therefore, **does not hold**.

---

## 3) Checking **(A2, A3) ‚Üí A1**

Again, we check pairs :

- **Row 1**: (2,3), A1=1
- **Row 2**: (2,3), A1=1
- **Row 3**: (7,8), A1=6
- **Row 4**: (1,3), A1=2

The only repeated pair is in rows **1** and **2**, and for both rows, . There‚Äôs **no conflict** there. The other pairs and appear only once, so they can‚Äôt conflict with anything.

Thus, **does hold**.

---

## Final Results

- **A4 ‚Üí A1:** **No** (fails on rows 1 & 4)
- **(A2, A3) ‚Üí A4:** **No** (fails on rows 1 & 2)
- **(A2, A3) ‚Üí A1:** **Yes** (no conflicts found)

So with the corrected data in **A2**, the **only** valid dependency of the three listed is .









> # ATTRIBUTE CLOSURE ALGORITHM





The **attribute closure algorithm** is a step-by-step process used to determine all the attributes that can be functionally determined from a given set of attributes, based on a set of functional dependencies. This "closure" is denoted as for a set . It's a key tool in database design, particularly for identifying candidate keys and checking whether a particular functional dependency holds.

---

## How the Algorithm Works

1. **Start with the Set :**  
   Begin with the closure initialized to itself.

2. **Iterate Through Functional Dependencies:**  
   Look at each functional dependency in your list.
   
   - If is a subset of your current closure , then add to .

3. **Repeat Until No More Attributes Can Be Added:**  
   Continue checking all dependencies repeatedly until no new attributes can be added to .

4. **Result:**  
   The final set is the attribute closure of ; it contains all attributes that are functionally determined by under the given set of functional dependencies.

---

## Simple Example

Suppose we have a relation with attributes , , , and and the following functional dependencies:

To find the closure of (i.e., ):

1. **Initialize:**  

2. **Apply :**  
   Since is in , add :  

3. **Apply :**  
   Now is in , so add :  

4. **Apply :**  
   is in , so add :  

5. **No More Dependencies:**  
   All dependencies have been applied, and the closure is complete.

**Result:**  

---

## Uses of the Attribute Closure Algorithm

- **Determining Candidate Keys:**  
  An attribute (or set of attributes) is a candidate key if its closure contains all attributes of the relation.

- **Checking Functional Dependencies:**  
  You can test if a dependency holds by verifying that is a subset of .

- **Normalization:**  
  It helps in finding minimal covers and achieving proper database normalization by understanding the full implications of the dependencies.

---

In summary, the attribute closure algorithm systematically collects all attributes that can be inferred from a starting set, providing crucial insight into the structure of the database schema and the relationships between attributes.
