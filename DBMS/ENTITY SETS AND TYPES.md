The terms **entity set** and **entity type** are both foundational concepts in database design (especially in the **Entity-Relationship (ER) model**), but they refer to different things. Here's a clear differentiation:

---

### ✅ **Entity Type**

- **Definition**: An entity type defines a **category of entities** that share the same attributes.
    
- **Think of it as**: A **blueprint or template** for entities.
    
- **Contains**:
    
    - Attribute names (e.g., `Name`, `Age`, `StudentID`)
        
    - A primary key to uniquely identify each entity.
        
- **Example**:  
    `Student` is an entity type with attributes like `StudentID`, `Name`, and `Age`.

### ✅ **Entity Set**

- **Definition**: An entity set is the **collection of actual entities** (data/records) that belong to an entity type.
    
- **Think of it as**: The **real-world data** that fits the blueprint.
    
- **Contains**:
    
    - Actual instances (rows in a table).
        
- **Example**:  
    An entity set of `Student` might include:
    
    ```
    { (101, "Alice", 20), (102, "Bob", 21), (103, "Carol", 22) }
    ```

### ⚖️ Comparison Table

|Feature|Entity Type|Entity Set|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|A definition of a group of entities|A collection of actual entities|
|Role|Acts as a template or schema|Represents data at a given point|
|Contains|Attribute definitions|Actual data/instances|
|Example|`Student(Name, Age, StudentID)`|`{ (101, "Alice", 20), (102, "Bob", 21) }`|
