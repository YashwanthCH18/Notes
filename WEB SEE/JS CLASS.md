Alright, let‚Äôs dive into the world of **JavaScript classes** ‚Äî a super clean and organized way to write object-oriented code. Think of classes like blueprints for creating objects. Once you get the hang of it, you‚Äôll feel like you're coding with ‚ú®power tools‚ú® instead of duct tape and dreams.

## üß† **Definition**

A **class** in JavaScript is a template for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. It's syntactic sugar over the older prototype-based inheritance.

---

## ‚úÖ **Rules to Follow**

1. Use the `class` keyword.
    
2. You must use the `constructor()` method to initialize object properties.
    
3. Use `this` to refer to the current object inside methods.
    
4. Methods go directly inside the class ‚Äî no `function` keyword needed.
    

---

## üîß **Syntax**

```javascript
class ClassName {
  constructor(property1, property2) {
    this.property1 = property1;
    this.property2 = property2;
  }

  methodName() {
    console.log(`Doing something with ${this.property1}`);
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Forgetting the `new` keyword when creating an object (`new ClassName()`).
    
- Using `function` keyword inside the class (you don‚Äôt need it!).
    
- Not using `this` inside methods to refer to properties.
    
- Defining multiple constructors (JavaScript classes only allow one).
    

---

## üì¶ **Examples**

### 1. A simple class with one method

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Rex");
myDog.bark(); // Rex says: Woof!
```

---

### 2. Class with multiple properties and methods

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand, year) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.year = year;
  }

  getAge(currentYear) {
    return currentYear - this.year;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2018);
console.log(myCar.getAge(2025)); // 7
```

---

### 3. Inheritance (one class extends another)

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Meow!`);
  }
}

const kitty = new Cat("Whiskers");
kitty.speak(); // Whiskers says: Meow!
```
